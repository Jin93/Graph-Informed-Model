# Graph-Informed-Model

We introduce a novel graph-informed modeling framework for improving the statistical analysis of gene expression data, particularly in the context of identifying differentially expressed gene pathways and gene expression-assisted disease classification in a high-dimensional data setting.

Please see [example code](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/tlpwb9foqrlh2d8hsjxhj/AOJ55l7bkO8ekFPPfE3c1ns?rlkey=vydqon07ytmmu3qg8wgm5o5nv&st=f3jweib8&dl=0) for conducting graph-informed gene pathway tests and gene expression-based classification.
